# The docker-compose.yml file describes the services that make your app. In this example those services are a web server and database. 
# The compose file also describes which Docker images these services use, how they link together, any volumes they might need to be mounted inside the containers. 
# Finally, the docker-compose.yml file describes which ports these services expose. See the docker-compose.yml reference for more information on how this file works.
